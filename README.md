# Tempolib
A "hopefully one day will be" beat detection algorithm, that runs by analysing a tempogram generated through periodic local pulse detection.

Check out the videos available in the Videos folder if you wanna see it working without having to download the project :D

Oh and this is by no means a finished thing. Its just a learning experience that i will hopefully continue to work one :D
